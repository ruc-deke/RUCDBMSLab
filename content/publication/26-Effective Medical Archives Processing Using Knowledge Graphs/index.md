# 文章摘要
abstract: Medical archives processing is a very important task in a medical information system. It generally consists of three steps medical archives recognition, feature extraction and text classification. In this paper, we focus on empowering the medical archives processing with knowledge graphs. We first build a semantic-rich medical knowledge graph. Then, we recognize texts from medical archives using several popular optical character recognition (OCR) engines, and extract keywords from texts using a knowledge graph based feature extraction algorithm. Third, we define a semantic measure based on knowledge graph to evaluate the similarity between medical texts, and perform the text classification task. This measure can value semantic relatedness between medical documents, to enhance the text classification. We use medical archives collected from real hospitals for validation. The results show that our algorithms can significantly outperform typical baselines that employs only term statistics.
