# 文章摘要
abstract: A piece of the bill of materials (a.b.a BOM) data is a hierarchical graph data model showing the assembly structure to manufacture an end product. The BOM is widely used in modeling product structures and is of great importance in high-end manufacturing. Therefore, the conduction of an in-depth benchmarking study on the BOM is of practical necessity for high-end manufacturing. While the state-of-the-art work focuses on a general graph model benchmarking, investigating a hierarchical graph data model benchmarking still remains an open problem. To address this issue, we make three contributions in this paper. First, we propose the BOM data generator by taking into consideration the given application scenario. Second, we abstract a group of queries that are widely used in high-end manufacturing. Third, we conduct an in-depth evaluation over both relational databases and graph databases that can be used to manage BOMs, and establish a unified evaluation benchmark for querying and modifying BOMs stored in different database systems.
